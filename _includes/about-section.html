         My name is Sam Ade, A.k.A The Writing Geek. Iâ€™m skilled in keyword research and content creation. I help companies shape their voices online, one character at a time. 
I am a seasoned content curator with extensive and varied writing experience. I have curated website content, articles, product reviews, white papers, marketing copies, educative articles, press releases, and so much more.

          I am also a typo finder and a grammar fixer.
I enjoy a steady flow of freelance work for a wide variety of clients and projects, and I ensure that my content is always creative, unique, and engaging.
Every copy I work on is formatted for the specific client's voice and audience, and I excel in deadline-/results-driven environments.

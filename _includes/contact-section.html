4.	Thrills online casino  launched as a new and exciting gambling site where players feel appreciated. The first strength of this operator, as well as the most obvious one, is the creative design that features nice colours and several casino mascots. The casino theme is strongly present throughout the entire site. This gives players a sense of belonging as they quickly attach to the mascots and feel more comfortable. A couple of years ago, the operator went through a serious transformation and, as a result, Thrills became a Pay N Play casino. The venue is now a devout promoter of responsible gaming.

          Traits and Characteristics of Cheaters
Introduction
How can one put a face to unfaithfulness? The simple answer is that you can't. Just as you’ve been conditioned to not judge a book by its cover, it's nearly impossible to look at someone’s face and, with a single look, recognize them as a cheater. The sad truth is, just about anyone can cheat on their partner. While you should not base your verdict on the type of stereotypical cheats that you see portrayed in Hollywood movies, there are some very common behavior traits that cheaters share. If you see any of these red flags waving in front of you, there’s a possibility that your partner is up to something.


Reasons People Cheat

Just about everyone agrees that being unfaithful to your partner is an abysmal thing to do, but the sad reality is that a lot of people in committed relationships are unfaithful. Finding out that someone you love is having an affair can be devastating. It may feel as though you will never fall in love with anyone else again. If your partner is being unfaithful, you may be struggling to understand why, especially if you thought they were happy and your relationship seemed healthy on the surface. Contrary to widespread belief, it’s not everyone that engages in an affair that has fallen out of love or lost interest in their partner. Unfaithfulness is a complicated thing, and no two affairs are exactly the same. So why do people in seemingly happy relationships cheat on their partners? Is there anything we can do to prevent it?

1. Digital devices being picked over partners: If there ever was a list of reasons for doing a digital detox, this should be the top one. In this digital age, couples spend most of their time on their digital devices instead of spending quality time together. Some couples go out to dinner only to spend the entire time on their phones. When people direct all their attention to their phones instead of their partners, it creates feelings of abandonment and insecurity, eventually leading their partners to seek attention elsewhere.

2. Sometimes, it just feels good to be bad: Instead of the common runner’s high, imagine a cheater’s high, with a dash of danger added. People who love danger tend to get addicted to this high. Think about a little kid that steals an item from someone and gets away with it. Fast forward 2 decades later, he could end up being the spouse who cheats, loves the danger, and feels like a total badass while doing it.

What Does Cheating Say about a person
1. Clingy people tend to cheat more: It might seem counterintuitive that an insecure person will be more likely to cheat, but people who have difficulty trusting their partners tend to portray needy behaviors. They are usually worried about being left and rejected by their partners, and so rather than putting faith in their relationship, clingy people tend to strike out on their own, trying to fight off an abandonment that has not even happened yet.

2. Fear of performing poorly during sex: Average sexual performance, or even worse, awful sex is common in relationships and can lead to constant performance concerns. On the other hand, having an affair with someone new presents a departure from the unending worry of poor sexual performance. That’s why some people cheat.

3. Blame genetics: This is another one of the traits that run in the family. Scientists have discovered that people’s propensity to cheat lies partially in their DNA. There’s a form of dopamine receptor gene known as DRD4. It has been connected to people’s tendency to cheat and engage in one-night stands. The main incentive is pleasure followed by a reward, and that’s where the release of dopamine comes into play.
4. Some cheaters just want a break from the responsibilities and pressures of everyday life. Falling in love with a person can be a life-changing, absorbing experience. Some people who cheat use the feelings that come with a passionate affair as a way to escape the daily grind. They might love their partner, family, home, and job, but also want some excitement. Engaging in an affair can be a very unhealthy and yet efficient way to spice things up. Instead of putting in work to make their life better, they tend to search out someone to give them a temporary boost.

                                                                                                                                Personality Trait of Cheaters
Despite the fact that there are often warning signs when a person’s partner is cheating, most people miss them because they are blinded by love. Below are some of the characteristics of serial cheaters:
1.	Impulse control issues: People with poor impulse control tend to do what feels good to them in the moment. This means that they don't stop to think of the consequences that could arise from their choices, one of which could be cheating on their partner. If you need to pay attention to this kind of impulsive behavior with your partner, note that it can unfold in numerous ways in a person's life, like immodest use of alcohol, spending, gambling, last minute changes of plans, and anger management issues.

2.	Poor sense of responsibility: Research has shown that people who are likely to cheat on their partners are also prone to having a poor sense of responsibility. They also tend to avoid honoring their commitments. Sadly, this means that they will not fulfil their promises and they won't think twice before letting their family and friends down. So, watch out for people with unstable job histories, who have fines and break the law, and who blame others for the things that happen to them.

3.	Small behavioral changes; it’s more about changes in behavior, and not just one change. You might notice changes in the way they use their cell phones, and how they don't ever let you touch it, even though before they used to leave it on the table carelessly. They might become more secretive, and they may believe that they need to do more exercise. Ultimately, they will change enough for you to take notice.

4.	Credit and Phone bills go missing: Another sign you should pay attention to is if phone credit card statements and bills are not making their way home. It’s probably because there are calls and items on them that they don't want you to see. So, if you haven't seen these things, it's probably because your partner thinks you are onto them. Partners of unfaithful men tend to see the credit card statements and notice items paid for like fur coats and golden bracelets that they didn’t receive.

5.	Talking about a particular person all the time: If your partner starts talking about someone a lot, especially in a derogatory and non-flattering way, it could be that they are trying to deflect you away from that person.

6.	They are obsessed with themselves: experts have claimed that most cheaters are narcissists. So, if your spouse lacks empathy and portrays traits of self-absorption, then they might be more likely to cheat. People like that thrive off of attention, and they might prioritize a new love interest over your feelings.

A common question people ask is how do cheaters feel about themselves? The answer is that they're usually insecure: Insecurity is a common trait in those who cheat. A constant need to feel loved and be reassured can lead to straying. People who cheat tend to be frightened that they aren’t good enough and that they will end up abandoned and alone, so they are always searching for a back-up plan.

7.	 They are greedy: People who cheat tend to believe that the grass is greener on the other side. This is why they relish exploring other options.


8.	They accuse their partners of cheating: Its a typical sign of a guilty conscience. Because they are experiencing the urge to have an affair, they put you in that same boat. Paranoia is a typical sign to look out for if you are trying to spot a possible cheat. Reliable, honest lovers will most likely never doubt you, since they do not doubt themselves.

9.	They love flirting with people: Cheaters enjoy flirting with every attractive person they come across, and they may do so even when they are with you. People like that get a thrill out of flirting. They might perceive it as an invitation to get intimate and it can eventually lead them to cheating on you.

10.	They are deceitful: If they have lied before, it’s likely that they will lie again. You need to be careful and watchful as this will give you an insight into their ethical code. It is worth noting that not everyone that lies is a cheat, - but every cheat is a liar.
So, if you’ve been wondering about the traits of a cheating woman or the characteristics of a cheating husband, there you have it.

Physical Behaviors of Cheaters/ Cheaters Behavior Patterns
If your partner is cheating, his/her behaviors are sure to change. What was once a normal behavior will likely be replaced by behaviors that you aren’t used to seeing in your spouse. Although not every change in behavior is an indication that your partner is cheating, you still should pay attention and if you suspect anything, dig deeper into why your partner is acting strangely. 

Below are the five cheating habits of a partner that you need to look out for:
1. Your partner becomes very concerned about their appearance. They start paying more attention to how their hair looks. They may start shopping for new and more stylish clothes, or clothes that will make them look younger. Your partner may also start paying more attention to hygiene. They may start wearing cologne, which is out of character for them. If your partner starts paying as much attention to their looks as they used to when you both first started dating, this might be a sign that something is up. Are they showering when they come home from work at evening time? That may be them trying to wash away the scent of their secret lover. It’s one of the strongest characteristics of a cheating husband. If they are dressing up really nice when they go to the mall, then they might not be out shopping but being up to mischief. This last point is specifically one of the traits of a cheating woman.

2. Your partner starts going to the gym: Has your partner always been on the chubby side? Are they now concerned with shaping up and losing weight all of a sudden? If your partner has never shown concern for their weight problems or their physical appearance before now, this new development might be a red flag. It’s most likely that they are attempting to be more good-looking for someone else.

3. New changes in their sexual behavior: This issue can manifest in two ways. If your partner is cheating and discovering new sexual tricks, they might want to try some of them out with you. And sometimes, they might have no sexual interest in you at all. If your partner is introducing new sexual tricks and positions into your relationship, it is only normal that you wonder where they’ve learned those tricks from. If your partner shows no interest at all in intimacy with you, it is also normal for you to wonder if they are getting sex from someone else. In certain cases where a physical affair has transformed into a love affair, the person cheating might refuse sex with their partner due to guilty feelings and them ironically not wanting to be unfaithful to their affair partners.
Has your spouse’s touch become very cold or very warm? A cheating spouse might behave towards you in one of those two ways. They either develop a sudden desire for increased sexual activity with you due to shame and guilt, or they’ll get icier and icier towards you as their desires are being flamed by someone else. Part of the transformations in intimacy and physical behavior will come as a result of your partner being introduced to new fantasies and sex styles by the person they are cheating with. This may lead to sudden changes in your experiences with your spouse behind closed doors. There is a whole lot that can be learnt from the way your spouse touches or stops touching you.

4. Has your partner suddenly become short-tempered? When a partner starts cheating, they may become short-tempered and less tolerant of family members. They may start to snap at things that didn’t used to bother them before. A cheating partner is likely to start arguments over little issues just to create a detachment from their partner. Creating that emotional distance between them and their partner helps to relieve them of any guilt that they may feel. It also helps them justify their act of cheating since they are now detached from their spouse. They may also start arguments to provide justification for leaving the house and staying out late. What better excuse to go out and hang with another man or woman than an argument?

5. Friends of your partner might start behaving oddly: Not only will the cheating partner’s behavior change, that of the friends who know and are covering for the cheating partner will also change. You should pay attention to how their friends are behaving whenever they are around you. Knowing exactly what to look out for and ending the affair quickly plays a big role in whether or not your relationship survives the affair. Also, knowing what exactly to look out for and putting together evidence quickly will help you decide whether or not you should file for divorce.

6. Paying attention to how they smell: One of the ways a cheating spouse is recognized is by them suddenly changing their smell. Scents, either pleasant or unpleasant, are very difficult to hide. Perfumes, cosmetics, after shaves, sweat, cigarettes, beverages, and food all leave a distinctive scent on a person. When we get close to another person, there’s always an exchange of smell. It stays on the skin, clothes, hair, car seats etc. Does your spouse rush to the bathroom to take a shower before saying hi when they arrive home? Have they suddenly started to do their own laundry? Do they come back home after being out for a long period of time smelling clean and fresh? Your partner hiding their scent may be as much a sign as having a new scent.

7.Changes in how they talk: What kind of things do you hear coming from your spouse? Has there been recent changes in their language? Do they still confide in you like they used to or have they become distant? Do they avoid certain topics of conversation? Do you notice their eyes light up when some particular friends are mentioned, or do they completely avoid talking about certain places and people? Do they seem to have really long conversations, or lots of back-and-forth texting with people that you don’t know? Do they start sudden arguments with you over things that didn’t matter to them before? You need to pay close attention to what your spouse is saying and isn’t saying. This can help to answer a lot of your questions.


Resist the Urge to Cheat
Are you currently experiencing the urge to cheat but don’t know how to make it stop? Knowing what fuels your urges is a crucial step in defeating the urge to stray. Knowing why you cheat is what will help you stop. A lot of people experience a fear of commitment. Some cheat to circumvent sexual conflict with their spouse. Some people also cheat because they are impetuous, and want to disrupt their main relationship, or because they want to exert revenge on their spouse because of something their spouse did. Other people may cheat simply because they are bored or even because they think cheating will bring back the flame in their stale relationship. Confess and practice being open with your spouse. It's the principal step to building trust back up with them again.

If your partner or spouse is cheating on you, it forces you to make some very important decisions. If you believe the best thing for you to do is leave, then you should. Leave amicably. Do not resort to violence. Criminal charges and jail time will definitely cause you to suffer and will prevent you from ensuring that the cheat gets what he/she deserves.

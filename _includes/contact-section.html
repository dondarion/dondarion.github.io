Tumaini School GoFundMe
The effect of poverty on education across East Africa remains a great challenge. Children are simply not receiving the education that they deserve. The Education Commission predicts that if current trends are left to continue, by 2030 only 4 out of 10 kids of school age will be able to gain basic secondary-level skills.
Needless to say, we have a huge crisis on our hands. Millions of the country’s most vulnerable currently live in over-populated informal settlements known as slums.
These informal settlements play host to dense populations and have very few public services. Lots of waterborne diseases, hunger, and poverty prevail in them.
However, Tumaini School has proven to be an oasis amidst the slum life. Here, little children enjoy primary and secondary education, safety, food, and clothing.  Tumaini currently sponsors hundreds of students in school with yearly scholarships.
While we at Tumaini have been doing our best to ensure that these kids can get access to quality education, we sadly admit that our efforts are not nearly enough. Due to the rainy season coming, we have an enormous challenge looming. So far, we have been teaching the kids outdoors, and in preparation for the rainy season, we need to construct a building that will shelter us from the storm when it comes. It is really important that we get the building completed as soon as possible. Millions of children across East Africa, of whom approximately 53% are girls, do not have access to basic education currently.

You can help right now! Your donation will help provide poor African students with quality education.
Children struggle a lot with learning if they don’t have access to textbooks. In a lot of cases, classrooms have no books at all, making it extremely difficult for the students to follow what their teacher is saying. This means that the students are likely to leave school without ever knowing how to read.
These beautiful, sweet children have been struggling to get just the bare necessities – water, food, cooking essentials, beds, medical care, clothes, and a whole lot more.
Without classrooms, these kids are forced to learn under trees. And without clean water and restrooms, they tend to get ill and skip school, and the girls are unable to take care of their periods properly and with dignity.
When classrooms do not have enough chairs and desks, children are forced to either sit six on a bench intended for two, or sit down on the floor. This makes them extremely uncomfortable, and they often get distracted from their learning. Just Imagine sitting on the ground or floor, crowded by other students, getting bitten by mites, placing your book on your lap to write, and stretching your neck to try and see the board. It’s an unbearable situation.
Please donate now so that more children can get the chance of a brighter future. We have been working hard and tirelessly to help these children get the kind of education they deserve, but we can’t do it without the devoted supporters that give their all to make it possible. People just like you.
You can change the life of these kids by bringing them hope through education. A lot of them are eager to learn but sadly do not have the means. With a little donation from you, you can change the path of their future and that of the world. When you work with us, you get the chance to visit us and see our work in Kenya.

Tumaini was founded by Margaret M. Ngatia a couple of years ago. For almost a decade now, she has been promoting the support of underprivileged children and youth through welfare, education, and mentorship. She continues to work tirelessly to ensure that these children benefit from the best possible school environment, but she cannot do it alone.
Now more than ever these kids need a positive school/classroom environment. This fundraiser was created with the goal of raising $40,000. With this, we will be able give these children the opportunity to learn in a positive school environment that will encourage them to attend, and also help build their social skills. The ultimate goal is to help these students succeed. Please help us out with whatever you can so that we can reach our goal.
This project will take us months to complete. The money we raise will cover the building materials as well as all the supplies needed. Margaret M. Ngatia will personally be overseeing the building of this school.
Big donations can make a huge difference. Philanthropic support and contributions from generous individuals such as yourself, trusts and foundations is the most powerful tool we have to fight against inequality and poverty.
Tumaini partners with rural and remote communities where little children are dropping out of school without attaining vital basic skills. Our unique style and approach helps teachers and parents create effective, sustainable schools perfect for nurturing their children's learning.
At Tumaini, we believe that children shouldn’t be forced to study outdoors, or in a dangerous and inconducive environment. With access to proper education, every child can escape poverty.
A significant donation will have an amazing impact on education in East Africa. You will be taking on a pivotal and personal role in helping to provide life-changing opportunities to millions of children.
£30,000 will help Tumaini build eight new classrooms

£5,000 will provide thousands of children with textbooks

£5,000 will help us buy pencils, art materials, and books for the library
Without books, desks, and learning materials, children in school won’t be able to learn.

PLEASE, HELP US MAKE IT HAPPEN!!!!!

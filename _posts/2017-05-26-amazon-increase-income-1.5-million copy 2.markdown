**The word "keto", is derived from "Ketogenic" or "Ketogenic Diet". It is a special diet regimen that emphasizes low-carbohydrate and high-fat. 
Similar to the Atkins and other low-carb diets, it entails a drastic reduction in the body's carbohydrate intake. Keto involves a reduction or switch from the carbohydrate reliance of the body while encouraging the body to run on fats and proteins. This metabolic state is called KETOSIS.
**

HOW KETO WORKS 
The human body primarily runs on the fuel of blood sugar that is supplied by glucose from carbohydrates. When the needed amount of sugar is unavailable for use, the body switches to an alternative source of fuel which is, fat. This is done by converting fat into ketones in the liver to supply energy to the brain and other body organs. 
A successfully implemented keto diet limits carb consumption to between 20-50 grams per day.
By the consumption of high levels of fats and a moderate amount of protein, while tremendously reducing sugar intake, more fat can be eliminated from the body. 

WHY KETO? 
Keto has been discovered to be a successful weight loss formula. Unlike the conventional weight loss formulas that emphasize a reduction in fat, keto operates in a way that is almost the exact opposite. 
By going into KETOSIS, the human body can concentrate on depleting the fat content of the body, thereby successfully achieving weight loss. 
It takes an average of about 3 days for ketosis to take effect. Once in full operation, it can benefit the body in many ways. Apart from helping you lose weight, keto diet prevents harmful diseases from attacking your body and helps to improve your general health.
It’s one of the few diet plans that accommodate 3 square meals a day and don’t require that you starve yourself.
